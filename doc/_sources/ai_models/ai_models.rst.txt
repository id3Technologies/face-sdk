AI Models
=========

This SDK makes extensive use of AI models, particularly for detection, analysis and facial recognition tasks.
Wherever possible, one model is used for several tasks, as in the case of the face attributes classifier model, which detects glasses, hats, make-up, mouth opening, smiles and gender. But as a general rule, an AI model is dedicated to a single task.

The following models are available:

.. |FaceBackgroundUniformityEstimator1A| replace:: face_background_uniformity_estimator_v1a.id3nn

AI model files
==============

AI model files have the ``.id3nn`` extension. You must copy the necessary data files into your application package. If you wish to reduce the size of your application, we recommend copying only the files required by the biometric algorithm.

In your application's source code you should specify location of these files.

.. warning::

    AI model files MUST NOT be renamed.


.. _model_loading:

Loading AI models
=================

It is recommended to load the AI models on application startup. The :ref:`face_library_class` provides methods for loading and unloading AI model file in memory.

An example is given below:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: C#
        :sync: csharp

        .. literalinclude:: /_static/samples/init.cs
            :language: c#
            :start-after: [load_models]
            :end-before: [load_models]
            :dedent: 12


Warming-up
==========

The first execution, or inference, of a model takes generally more time. 
To mitigate this problem, a warm-up method can be called on application startup to prepare the inference of model.

For example, you can prepare the face detection model by calling the :ref:`face_detector_warm_up_class_method`.

Processing unit
===============

The inference of the AI models can be executed on either the CPU or the GPU if avaialble.
To enable execution on the GPU, the corresponding library must be used.
