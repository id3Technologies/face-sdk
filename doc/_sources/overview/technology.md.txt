# Technology

## Overview

Thanks to many years of research and development in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence, our experts have designed a unique algorithm that reproduces the visual recognition abilities of the human brain.

With the power of deep learning techniques trained on millions of faces, our technology outperforms human performance enabling unconstrained/non-voluntary real-time detection and recognition of faces in a crowd. It operates on any type of people face whatever the gender, age or race and is robust to intra-personal variations such as ageing, facial hair, scars/injuries, accessories (e.g. glasses, hats, etc.), cosmetics, etc. The technology is also robust to variations of the lightning conditions and has the ability to work with a large range of cameras under either visible or near-infrared light.

The face identification process is nearly instantaneous. It has the capability to compare millions of faces in less than one second on a single processing unit. The matching algorithm has also very low resource requirements enabling possible applications on secure elements.

id3 Technologies face recognition algorithm has proven excellent tradeoff between accuracy, speed and template size in the NIST ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT).


## Biometric Performance

The overall accuracy of a facial recognition system may vary according to a number of factors such as:

- Quality of the camera system,
- Lighting conditions,
- Facial pose variations,
- Population under test,
- etc.

**Performance metrics**

False non match rate (FNMR) is the proportion of mated comparisons below a threshold set to achieve the false match rate (FMR) specified. FMR is the proportion of impostor comparisons at or above that threshold. Since FMR and FNMR is in inverse proportion to each other, choosing the operational threshold is a trade-off between system security and user convenience.

## NIST FRVT evaluation

The Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) was initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) in February 2017. It is aimed at measurement of the performance of automated face recognition technologies applied to a wide range of civil, law enforcement and homeland security applications including verification of visa images, de-duplication of passports, recognition across photojournalism images, and identification of child exploitation victims.

### FRVT datasets

**Visa images**

- The images have geometry in reasonable conformance with the ISO/IEC 19794-5 Full Frontal image type. Pose is generally excellent.
- The images are of size 252x300 pixels. The mean interocular distance (IOD) is 69 pixels.
- The images are of subjects from greater than 100 countries, with significant imbalance due to visa issuance patterns.
- The images are of subjects of all ages, including children, again with imbalance due to visa issuance demand.
- Many of the images are live capture. A substantial number of the images are photographs of paper photographs.

**Mugshot images**

- The images have geometry in reasonable conformance with the ISO/IEC 19794-5 Full Frontal image type.
- The images are of variable sizes. The median IOD is 104 pixels. The mean IOD is 123 pixels.
- The images are of subjects from the United States.
- The images are of adults.
- The images are all live capture.

**Wild images**

- The images include many photojournalism-style images. Images are given to the algorithm using a variable but generally tight crop of the head. Resolution varies very widely. The images are very unconstrained, with wide yaw and pitch pose variation. Faces can be occluded, including hair and hands.
- The images are of adults.
- All of the images are live capture, none are scanned.

The face encoder 9A of this SDK corresponds to the *id3_008* submission.
