Face detection
==============

The :ref:`FaceDetector<face_detector_class>` class detects human faces in still images.

.. important:: The face detector requires the relevant AI models to run. See :ref:`face_detection_models` for details.

.. _detected_face:

The face detector outputs a list of :ref:`DetectedFace<detected_face_class>` objects containing the following information:

- An identifier
- A face detection score
- The :ref:`face_detection_face_bounds`
- The :ref:`face_detection_portrait_bounds`
- The interocular distance (IOD)
- The 5 landmark features (eyes, nose and mouth)

.. warning:: The identifier is an auto-incremented value and is not linked to a user's identity.

.. _face_detection_portrait_bounds:
.. include:: portrait_bounds.rst

Tolerance
=========

The face detection tolerance depends on the AI model used. The following characteristics can be assumed:

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 30 70

    * - Face angle tolerance
      - yaw < ±45°, pitch < ±30°, roll < 45°
      
    * - Minimal interocular distance (IOD)
      - 10 pixels

.. warning:: The algorithm searches for faces in the range [16px;512px]. If the image is too large to fit this range, one must resize it before the detection process.
.. hint:: For optimum facial recognition performance, a minimum distance of 100 pixels between eyes is recommended.

Parameters
==========

The face detector is configured by default with the most common parameters. For specific applications, it may be useful to adjust certain parameters.

The following parameters are defined:

.. list-table:: 
  :width: 100%
  :widths: 30 70
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Name
    - Description

  * - Confidence threshold
    - | Value above which the detector considers the detected element to be a face.
      | Setting a high threshold reduces false detection but can increase the number of undetected faces.

  * - Model
    - :ref:`face_detection_models` used to detect faces.
  
  * - NMS IoU threshold
    - | Non-maximum suppression (NMS) intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold.
      | Setting a high threshold allows to detect more overlapping faces which can be useful in a multi-face scenario. On the contrary, in a portrait scenario, a low NMS IoU threshold should be preferred.

      .. image:: /_static/images/iou.bmp
        :width: 264

  * - Thread count
    - Number of threads to use for face detection. Default is 1.
