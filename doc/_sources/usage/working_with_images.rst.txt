Working with images 
===================

|product-name| provides the necessary methods to work with static images coming from various sources. Please refer to the :ref:`image_class` for full reference.

.. important:: When creating an :ref:`Image<image_class>` object, the :ref:`PixelFormat<pixel_format_enum>` must be set to ``bgr24Bits``.

Loading an image from a file
============================

To load an image into the memory you need to create an Image object that will contain the image's content. The image can be loaded from a file:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /_static/samples/init.cs
       :language: c#
       :start-after: [load_image]
       :end-before: [load_image]
       :dedent: 12

Or from a memory buffer, either a vector or a raw pointer:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. literalinclude:: /_static/samples/init.cs
       :language: c#
       :start-after: [load_image]
       :end-before: [load_image]
       :dedent: 12
