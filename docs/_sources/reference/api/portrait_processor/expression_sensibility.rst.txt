PortraitProcessor.expressionSensibility Property
===============================================================================

Module: :ref:`PortraitProcessor<portrait_processor_class>`

Type: int

Definition
----------

Sensibility of the expression classifier.

The higher the value, the more sensitive the algorithm will be, meaning that it will be less likely to estimate neutral expression out of the detected face.

.. hint:: Default value is 60.
