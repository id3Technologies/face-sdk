====================
Portrait processing
====================

The :ref:`PortraitProcessor<portrait_processor_class>` module facilitates the capture and analysis of portraits in various scenarios such as enrolment or face verification.

The module is fed with images and performs the following operations:

* Face detection and tracking with prediction models
* Landmark detection (68 points)
* Head pose estimation
* Subject's position verification
* Template encoding and updating
* :ref:`Additional processing options<additional_portrait_processing_options>`
* Verification of compliance on a number of :ref:`quality check points<portrait_quality_check_points>`
* Unified quality score computation

.. important:: 
  The following AI models are required by the :ref:`PortraitProcessor<portrait_processor_class>` module:

  - ``FaceDetector4B`` or another preferred face detector (see :ref:`face_detection` for details).
  - ``FaceEncoder9B``, or another preferred face encoder (see :ref:`face_encoding` for details).
  - ``FaceLandmarksEstimator2A``
  - ``FacePoseEstimator1A``


Creating and analyzing a portrait
=================================

A Portrait is created using either the :ref:`portrait_processor_analyze_portrait_class_method` or :ref:`portrait_processor_update_portrait_class_method`.

Use preferrably the :ref:`updatePortrait<portrait_processor_update_portrait_class_method>` method if the image comes from a camera or video stream.

For single image analysis, the :ref:`analyzePortrait<portrait_processor_analyze_portrait_class_method>` should be used.

.. _additional_portrait_processing_options:

Processing options
=============================
Additional processing options are available and can be enabled depending on the application requirements:

.. _portrait_quality_check_points:

Quality check points
====================

The :ref:`PortraitProcessor<portrait_processor_class>` module verifies the compliance to the following quality check points:

.. important:: The quality check points are verified only if the associated processing option is enabled.

Photographic quality
--------------------

* The image is well exposed.
* The brightness is well balanced.
* The image is coloured, not grayscale.
* The skin looks natural.
* The image resolution is correct.
* The dynamic range of the image is correct.
* The image is sharp.
* No flash reflection is visible.
* No noise is present in the image.
* The image is not pixelated.
* No red-eye is present.
* The background is uniform.

Facial attributes
-----------------

* The subject's face is frontal.
* The face expression is neutral.
* The eyes are visible.
* The eyes are open.
* The subject does not wear glasses.
* The subject looks straight towards the camera.
* The mouth is visible.
* The mouth is closed.
* The subject is not smiling.
* The subject does not wear a hat.
* The nose is visible.
  
Geometry
--------

* The height of the head in the image is correct.
* The width of the head in the image is correct.
* The horizontal position of the head in the image is correct.
* The vertical position of the head in the image is correct.

.. note:: 
  Vertical position is the distance from the bottom edge of the image to the imaginary line passing through the center of the eyes, in percentage of the total vertical length of the image.


Example
=======

The example below demonstrates how to analyze a portrait on an image:

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Python
    :sync: Python

    .. literalinclude:: /../samples/sample.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [portrait_processing]
      :end-before: [portrait_processing]
      :dedent: 4
