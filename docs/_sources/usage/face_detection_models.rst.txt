    * - Model
      - Size
      - Description

    * - FaceDetector4A
      - 8.29 MB
      - This model provides the best accuracy. It is recommended for 1-to-N applications or in an uncontrolled environment.

    * - FaceDetector4B
      - 1.25 MB
      - This model provides a good balance of accuracy, speed, and size. This model is less robust to variations of head pose than the 4A version and should therefore only be used in a controlled environment.

    * - FaceDetector3A
      - 57.66 MB
      - :guilabel:`Obsolete`. Provided for backward compatibility. Use model 4A whenever possible.

    * - FaceDetector3B
      - 0.98 MB
      - :guilabel:`Obsolete`. Provided for backward compatibility. Use model 4B whenever possible.

    * - FaceDetector3C
      - 0.22 MB
      - Ultra-light detector, dedicated to short-range real-time detection/tracking applications only.

.. note:: Call the :ref:`face_library_load_model_class_method` to load the chosen model on application start.

.. hint:: On startup, call the :ref:`face_detector_warm_up_class_method` to prepare inference of the AI model.
