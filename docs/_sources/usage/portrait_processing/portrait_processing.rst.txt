Portrait processing
====================

|product-name| can analyse a wide range of facial attributes. For instance, it can evaluate the compliancy of a portrait to the ISO/IEC 19794-5 full frontal and the ICAO Portrait Quality Standards thanks to the following modules:


.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 30 70
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Description

    * - :ref:`Age<age_estimation>`
      - Estimated age of the subject

    * - :ref:`Background uniformity<background_uniformity>`
      - Color and structure uniformity of the background in a portrait image.

    * - :ref:`eye_gaze`
      - Estimated gaze direction for both eyes. When the subject looks directly towards the camera, the return values equal 0.

    * - :ref:`eye_opening`
      - Degree of opening of both eyes.

    * - :ref:`face_attributes`
      - Group of additional attributes:
        
        - Glasses
        - Hat
        - Make-up
        - Male (gender estimation)
        - Mouth opening
        - Smile

    * - :ref:`face_expression`
      - Estimated facial expressions of a subject classified in six universal emotions: angriness, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and additionally neutral.

    * - :ref:`face_mask`
      - Presence of a protective mask on the subject face.

    * - :ref:`Gender<gender_estimation>`
      - Gender estimation

    * - :ref:`geometric_attributes`
      - Set of geometric characteristics of a portrait image.

    * - :ref:`Glasses<glasses_detection>`
      - Additional set of attributes related to glasses (if present).
 
    * - :ref:`Head pose<head_pose>`
      - Estimation of the head pose.

    * - :ref:`image_colorization`
      - Value indicating whether an image is colorized or grayscale.

    * - :ref:`landmarks`
      - Estimated 68 landmark features

    * - :ref:`Mouth opening<mouth_detection>`
      - Mouth opening detection

    * - :ref:`noise`
      - Quantity of noise in the image.

    * - :ref:`occlusions`
      - Presence of occlusions on the subject's face (eyes, nose, mouth).

    * - :ref:`photographic_attributes`
      - Photographic quality attributes such as brigthness, dynamic range, flash reflection, natural skin color, exposure, pixelation, sharpness.

    * - :ref:`Red eyes<red_eye>`
      - Detect if a person's eyes are red or not (due to flash mostly).


Parameters
----------

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 30 70
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Parameter 
      - Description

    * - Expression sensibility 
      - The sensibility of the expression classifier.
        The higher the value, the more sensitive the algorithm will be, meaning that it will be less likely to estimate neutral expression out of the detected face.
        Default value is 60.
    
    * - Over-exposure sensibility
      - Sensibility of the over-exposure classifier. 
        The higher the value, the more sensitive the algorithm will be, meaning that it will be more likely to estimate over-exposed face images.
        Default value is 70.

    * - Under-exposure sensibility
      - Sensibility of the under-exposure classifier.
        The higher the value, the more sensitive the algorithm will be, meaning that it will be more likely to estimate under-exposed face images.
        Default value is 70.
