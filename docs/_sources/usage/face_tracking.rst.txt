=============
Face tracking
=============

The :ref:`FaceTracker<face_tracker_class>` class tracks faces in consecutive frames. It detects faces with motion prediction models that make it robust to occlusions.
It also automatically creates and consolidates templates over time. 

.. important:: The face tracker requires the relevant AI models to run. See :ref:`face_detection_models` for details.

The face tracker outputs a list of :ref:`TrackedFace<tracked_face_class>` objects containing similar information as in a :ref:`DetectedFace<detected_face_class>`:

- An identifier
- A face detection score
- The :ref:`face bounds<face_detection_face_bounds>`
- The :ref:`portrait bounds<face_detection_portrait_bounds>`
- The interocular distance (IOD)
- The 5 landmark features (eyes, nose and mouth)

Plus the following:

- The :ref:`predicted_bounds`
- The consolidated :ref:`face_template`

.. _predicted_bounds:

Predicted bounds
================

Predicted bounds are computed using a Kalman filter which has the effect of making them smooth and robust to false non-detections.

Parameters
==========

The face tracker defines the following parameters:

  :width: 100%
  :widths: 30 70
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Name
    - Description
  * - Detection model
    - :ref:`face_detection_models` used to detect faces.
  * - Detection threshold
    - | Confidence threshold of the face detector. Range is 0-100. Default value is 50.
  * - Encoding model
    - | Model used to create features and assess consistancy among views of a given face. Default value is FaceEncoder9B.
      | Some better accuracy/speed balances can be found by choosing another model.
  * - Matching threshold
    - | Minimum match score to reach to preserve the ID of a tracked face between frame 't-1' and frame 't'.
      | Default value is 3000 which corresponds to a False Match Rate of 1/1000.
  * - Maximum tracked face age
    - | Maximum number of consecutive non-detections to reach before deleting a tracked face.
      | Default value is 30 which corresponds to 2s at a frame rate of 15 FPS.
      | One must adapt this value to its needs in terms of tracker identity memory (in seconds) and measured frame rate on target platform.
  * - Minimum tracked face age
    - | Minimum number of consecutive detections to reach before creating a tracked face. 
      | Default value is 1 for FaceDetector3B since the false detection rate is low enough.
      | If using a less accurate detector (such as FaceDetector3C) one might consider increasing a bit this value to avoid false tracks.
  * - NMS IOU threshold
    - | Non-maximum suppression (NMS) intersection-over-union (IOU) threshold.
      | Setting a high threshold allows to detect more overlapping faces which can be useful in a multi-face scenario. On the contrary, in a portrait scenario, a low NMS IOU threshold should be preferred.
  * - Thread count
    - Number of threads to use for face detection. Default is 1.
