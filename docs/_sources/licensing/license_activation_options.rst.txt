License activation options
==========================

The activation of a license is required prior to use any module of this SDK.
The following license activation options are available:

- **Serial number**: Formatted as ``XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX``, it allows only one activation.
- **Activation key**: Formatted as ``email-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX``, it allows activations on multiple devices with a single code.
- **Customer identifiers**: Login/Password
 
.. important:: 
    An internet connection is required to complete the activation procedure.
    Unless the ``Online`` option is enabled, once the license is activated, the internet is no longer required.

.. note:: During the activation procedure, the SDK license is bound to a uniquely identified ID. See :ref:`license_hardware_id` for details.


License manager (Windows only)
==============================
On windows the graphical License Manager application may also be used to activate licenses. Please refer to the License Manager user's guide for more details.

Please note that on windows, and windows only, you can lock your license on a USB device.

Command-line interface
======================

A command-line activation software is available in the `activation/cli-tool` directory.

For example on linux x64:

    .. line-block::
    
        cd activation/cli-tool/linux/x64
        chmod +x id3LicenseActivationCLI
        ./id3LicenseActivationCLI --help

Programmatic activation
=======================

It is generally preferred to activate the license programmatically within your application. 
See :ref:`license_activation` in the :ref:`sdk_usage` section for details.

.. note:: On mobile devices, the :ref:`license_hardware_id` is linked to the application itself, so programmatic activation is the only way to activate a license in this case.
