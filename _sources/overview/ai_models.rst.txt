    * - FaceMaskClassifier2A
      - Detects the presence of a protective mask on a subject's face. 

    * - FaceOcclusionDetector2A
      - Detects occlusions on the subject's face (eyes, nose, mouth) 

    * - FacePeriocularEncoder2A
      - Encodes templates using only the periocular region of the subject's  face. Highest accuracy periocular encoder in this SDK. Provides an efficient alternative to face encoders when people wear masks in server-based 1:N applications. 

    * - FacePoseEstimator1A
      - Estimates the pose of the face (yaw pitch, roll).
