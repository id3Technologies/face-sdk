Geometric Attributes
====================

|product-name| allows to compute the following geometric attributes of a detected face:

- **Resolution**: Checks if the image resolution is sufficient.
- **Vertical position**: Checks the distance from the bottom edge of the image to the imaginary line passing through the center of the eyes is between 50\% - 70\% of the total vertical length of the image.
- **Horizontal position**: Checks if the head is correctly centered horizontally.
- **Width of head**: Checks if the image width is conform to the (image width / head width) ratio of 7:5. The head width is defined as the distance between the left and right ears.
- **Length of head**:  Checks if the distance between the base of the chin and the crown is less than 80\% of the total height of the image.
