Activating a license
--------------------

The id3 Face SDK needs a license file to be used. To retrieve this license file you will need either:

- An id3 serial key (formatted as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX): it allows activation (and further retrieval of the license file) on a single computer
- An id3 activation key (formatted as email-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX): it allows activations (and further retrievals of the license file) on several computers and can be re-credited upon request 
- (A login / password / product reference) triplet: same behaviour as the activation key

This license file can be retrieved through different methods depending of your operating system:
