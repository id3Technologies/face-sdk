Face search is the process in which a probe template is searched against the reference templates of more than one subject. It returns a candidate list.

The :ref:`FaceMatcher<face_matcher_class>` module provides a search method that performs a one-to-many search of a biometric probe against a previously initialized dictionary of biometric references. This method is generally used when the database size is relatively small (up to 1000 templates).

For large databases (over 1000 templates), the :ref:`FaceIndexer<face_indexer_class>` module offers a more efficient way of performing a one-to-many search. From an index file created from a list of :ref:`face templates<face_template_class>`, it uses modern indexing techniques for fast, lossless searching.
